My collected rationales for placing these libraries in the public domain\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Public domain vs. viral licenses

Why is this library public domain? Because more people will use it. Because it\textquotesingle{}s not viral, people are not obligated to give back, so you could argue that it hurts the development of it, and then because it doesn\textquotesingle{}t develop as well it\textquotesingle{}s not as good, and then because it\textquotesingle{}s not as good, in the long run maybe fewer people will use it. I have total respect for that opinion, but I just don\textquotesingle{}t believe it myself for most software.
\item Public domain vs. attribution-\/required licenses

The primary difference between public domain and, say, a Creative Commons commercial / non-\/share-\/alike / attribution license is solely the requirement for attribution. (Similarly the BSD license and such.) While I would {\itshape appreciate} acknowledgement and attribution, I believe that it is foolish to place a legal encumberment (i.\+e. a license) on the software {\itshape solely} to get attribution.

In other words, I\textquotesingle{}m arguing that PD is superior to the BSD license and the Creative Commons \textquotesingle{}Attribution\textquotesingle{} license. If the license offers anything besides attribution -- as does, e.\+g., CC Non\+Commercial-\/\+Share\+Alike, or the GPL -- that\textquotesingle{}s a separate discussion.
\item Other aspects of BSD-\/style licenses besides attribution

Permissive licenses like zlib and BSD license are perfectly reasonable in their requirements, but they are very wordy and have only two benefits over public domain\+: legally-\/mandated attribution and liability-\/control. I do not believe these are worth the excessive verbosity and user-\/unfriendliness these licenses induce, especially in the single-\/file case where those licenses tend to be at the top of the file, the first thing you see.

To the specific points, I have had no trouble receiving attribution for my libraries; liability in the face of no explicit disclaimer of liability is an open question, but one I have a lot of difficulty imagining there being any actual doubt about in court. Sometimes I explicitly note in my libraries that I make no guarantees about them being fit for purpose, but it\textquotesingle{}s pretty absurd to do this; as a whole, it comes across as \char`\"{}here is a library to decode   vorbis audio files, but it may not actually work and if   you have problems it\textquotesingle{}s not my fault, but also please   report bugs so I can fix them\char`\"{}--so dumb!

\DoxyCodeLine{I make my libraries public domain. You don't have to.}
\DoxyCodeLine{But my goal in releasing stb-\/style libraries is to}
\DoxyCodeLine{reduce friction for potential users as much as}
\DoxyCodeLine{possible. That means:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  a. easy to build (what this file is mostly about)}
\DoxyCodeLine{  b. easy to invoke (which requires good API design)}

\DoxyCodeLine{I choose to place all my libraries in the public}
\DoxyCodeLine{domain, abjuring copyright, rather than license}
\DoxyCodeLine{the libraries. This has some benefits and some}
\DoxyCodeLine{drawbacks.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Any license which is "{}viral"{} to modifications}
\DoxyCodeLine{causes worries for lawyers, even if their programmers}
\DoxyCodeLine{aren't modifying it.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Any license which requires crediting in documentation}
\DoxyCodeLine{adds friction which can add up. Valve has a huge list}
\DoxyCodeLine{(http://nothings.org/remote/ThirdPartyLegalNotices\_steam\_2019.html)}
\DoxyCodeLine{of all of these included in each game they ship,}
\DoxyCodeLine{and it's insane, and obviously nobody ever looks}
\DoxyCodeLine{at it so why would you care whether your credit}
\DoxyCodeLine{appeared there?}

\DoxyCodeLine{Permissive licenses like zlib and BSD license are}
\DoxyCodeLine{perfectly reasonable, but they are very wordy and}

\DoxyCodeLine{However, public domain has frictions of its own, because}
\DoxyCodeLine{public domain declarations aren't necessary recognized}
\DoxyCodeLine{in the USA and some other locations. For that reason,}
\DoxyCodeLine{I recommend a declaration along these lines:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{// This software is dual-\/licensed to the public domain and under the following}
\DoxyCodeLine{// license: you are granted a perpetual, irrevocable license to copy, modify,}
\DoxyCodeLine{// publish, and distribute this file as you see fit.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{I typically place this declaration at the end of the initial}
\DoxyCodeLine{comment block of the file and just say 'public domain'}
\DoxyCodeLine{at the top.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{I have had people say they couldn't use one of my}
\DoxyCodeLine{libraries because it was only "{}public domain"{} and didn't}
\DoxyCodeLine{have the additional fallback clause, who asked if}
\DoxyCodeLine{I could dual-\/license it under a traditional license.}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{My answer: they can create a derivative work by}
\DoxyCodeLine{modifying one character, and then license that however}
\DoxyCodeLine{they like. (Indeed, *adding* the zlib or BSD license}
\DoxyCodeLine{would be such a modification!) Unfortunately, their}
\DoxyCodeLine{lawyers reportedly didn't like that answer. :(}
