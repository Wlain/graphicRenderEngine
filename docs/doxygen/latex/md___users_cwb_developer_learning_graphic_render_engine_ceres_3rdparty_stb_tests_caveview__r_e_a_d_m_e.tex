There\textquotesingle{}s no GUI. Find a directory with Minecraft Anvil files (.mca). Copy a Minecraft \char`\"{}terrain.\+png\char`\"{} into that directory (do a google image search).

Not very. Many Minecraft blocks are not handled correctly\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item No redstone, rails, or other \char`\"{}flat\char`\"{} blocks
\item No signs, doors, fences, carpets, or other complicated geometry
\item Stairs are turned into ramps
\item Upper slabs turn into lower slabs
\item Wood types only for blocks, not stairs, slabs, etc
\item Colored glass becomes regular glass
\item Glass panes become glass blocks
\item Water is opaque
\item Water level is incorrect
\item No biome coloration
\item Cactus is not shrunk, shows holes
\item Chests are not shrunk
\item Double-\/chests draw as two chests
\item Pumpkins etc. are not rotated properly
\item Torches are drawn hackily, do not attach to walls
\item Incorrect textures for blocks that postdate terrain.\+png
\item Transparent textures have black fringes due to non-\/premultiplied-\/alpha
\item Skylight and block light are combined in a single value
\item Only blocks at y=1..255 are shown (not y=0)
\item If a 32x32x256 \char`\"{}quad-\/chunk\char`\"{} needs more than 800K quads, isn\textquotesingle{}t handled (very unlikely)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Some of these are due to engine limitations, and some of these are because I didn\textquotesingle{}t make the effort since my goal was to make a demo for \mbox{\hyperlink{stb__voxel__render_8h_source}{stb\+\_\+voxel\+\_\+render.\+h}}, not to make a proper Minecraft viewer.\hypertarget{md___users_cwb_developer_learning_graphic_render_engine_ceres_3rdparty_stb_tests_caveview__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md634}{}\doxysubsection{Could this be turned into a proper Minecraft viewer?}\label{md___users_cwb_developer_learning_graphic_render_engine_ceres_3rdparty_stb_tests_caveview__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md634}
Yes and no. Yes, you could do it, but no, it wouldn\textquotesingle{}t really resemble this code that much anymore.

You could certainly use this engine to render the parts of Minecraft it works for, but many of the things it doesn\textquotesingle{}t handle it can\textquotesingle{}t handle at all (stairs, water, fences, carpets, etc) because it uses low-\/precision coordinates to store voxel data.

You would have to render all of the stuff it doesn\textquotesingle{}t handle through another rendering path. In a game (not a viewer) you would need such a path for movable entities like doors and carts anyway, so possibly handling other things that way wouldn\textquotesingle{}t be so bad.

Rails, ladders, and redstone lines could be implemented by using tex2 to overlay those effects, but you can\textquotesingle{}t rotate tex1 and tex2 independently, so there may be cases where the underlying texture needs a different rotation from the overlaid texture, which would require separate rendering. Handling redstone\textquotesingle{}s brightness being different from underlying block\textquotesingle{}s brightness would require separate rendering.

You can use the face-\/color effect to do biome coloration, but the change won\textquotesingle{}t be smooth the way it is in Minecraft.\hypertarget{md___users_cwb_developer_learning_graphic_render_engine_ceres_3rdparty_stb_tests_caveview__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md635}{}\doxysubsection{Why isn\textquotesingle{}t building the mesh data faster?}\label{md___users_cwb_developer_learning_graphic_render_engine_ceres_3rdparty_stb_tests_caveview__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md635}
Partly because converting from minecraft data is expensive.

Here is the approximate breakdown of an older version of this executable and lib that did the building single-\/threaded.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 25\% loading \& parsing minecraft files (4/5ths of this is my crappy zlib)
\item 18\% converting from minecraft blockids \& lighting to stb blockids \& lighting
\item 10\% reordering from data\mbox{[}z\mbox{]}\mbox{[}y\mbox{]}\mbox{[}x\mbox{]} (minecraft-\/style) to data\mbox{[}y\mbox{]}\mbox{[}x\mbox{]}\mbox{[}z\mbox{]} (stb-\/style)
\item 40\% building mesh data
\item 7\% uploading mesh data to Open\+GL
\end{DoxyItemize}

I did do significant optimizations after the above, so the final breakdown is different, but it should give you some sense of the costs.
